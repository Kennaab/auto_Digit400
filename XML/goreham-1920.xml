<!--ebb: You can make a separate XML file for each car you're researching, but you could keep the same kinds of data about each car.
You can write a Relax NG schema that identifies the elements and attributes and kinds of values you will use for each entry. 
Some of the numbers will be integers or decimals.
Units of measure for power, transmission, speed will change as you get into later cars!
