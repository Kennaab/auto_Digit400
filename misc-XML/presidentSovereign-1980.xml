            Top speed isn't always listed for every model, but seems to be listed for the older ones. 
            I'm just trying out some different ways to code the information they're providing. 
            You can reach into this code later to compare makes and models based on something of interest to you.

<!--ebb: You can make a separate XML file for each car you're researching, but you could keep the same kinds of data about each car.
You can write a Relax NG schema that identifies the elements and attributes and kinds of values you will use for each entry. 
Some of the numbers will be integers or decimals.
Units of measure for power, transmission, speed will change as you get into later cars! 

If you like what you're seeing here, try writing a Relax NG schema for it. 
You'll be able to write XPath and XQuery over code like this to pull out related kinds of data, make charts and graphs to compare models and display in HTML.
