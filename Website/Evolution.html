        <p>Datsun models have not stayed the same, and one thing noticeable is that it is not only a class of Nissan, but they have their own subcategories as well.</p>
        <p>For example, there were not only Datsun <span class="subcategory">commercial</span> cars, but <span class="subcategory">vans</span>, <span class="subcategory">sports</span>, and even <span class="subcategory">trucks.</span></p>
