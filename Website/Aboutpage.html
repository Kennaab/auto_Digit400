        <h1>Nissan Motor Company</h1>
        <p>Japan Industries, also known as <span class=persName>Nihon Sangyou</span>, merged with what was known as Nissan Motor Company in 1931. The CEO of Nihon Sangyou, Yoshisuke Aikawa was excited about the auto company. When other shareholders were less enthusiastic Aikawa bought them out and began focusing on building the Nissan Motor Company. Nissan continued to make the Datsun car they were working on for the previous years. The company had also been producing trucks and planes for the Japanese army. </p>

        <p>At the beginning of Nissan, you could find some paved roads in the Japanse cities, but those were the exceptions and
        most roads and streets were just pebbles and sand. Railroads were becoming the favorite means of long-distance
        transportation. In 1930 Nissan Motor Company developed it's first small car, which was named
        Datson. Meaning, "son of DAT." </p>
        
        <p>DAT came from Kwaishinsha Jidosha Kojo and was founded in 1911 by M. Hashimoto. Hashimoto's dream
        was to make cars that were more suited to Japan. </p>
