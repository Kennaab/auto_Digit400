        Hello, my name is McKenna Ballew. I am a Senior at Penn State Behrend, majoring in DIGIT. 
        The reason I wanted to choose this subject for my DIGIT 400 Project is due to my love for cars in general. 
        I grew up working on cars with my dad and it has always been a great way for us to become closer, not only that
        I can do basic maintance on my own car.
